            <h2>Areas of low confidence</h2>
            <p>
                While I'm enthusiastic there are areas where I still feel I need more practice:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Complex javascript topics like asynchronous programming and memory managment.</li>
                <li>Advance CSS and animation techniques.</li>
                <li>Setting up build tools and deployment pipelines from scratch.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Note to My Future Self</h2>
            <p>
                "Hey, future Khadija! I hope you're still coding and still learning. Remember how challenging some of these concepts seemed? I hope you've mastered them and are now tackling even bigger problems. Don't forget to stay curious and never stop building."

            <h2>Extra Thoughts</h2>
            <p>
                I'm really excited to be part of this program. The "build-in-public" and project-based approach is exactly what I was looking for. I'm ready to learn, contribute, and grow!
