## ‚úÖ Core Requirements Checklist

This project successfully implements all the core requirements from the task description:

-   [x] **All `data-testid` Attributes:** Every required element includes the specified `data-testid` for automated testing.
-   [x] **Semantic HTML:** The structure uses semantic tags like `<article>`, `<header>`, `<section>`, `<figure>`, and `<nav>` to improve accessibility and SEO.
-   [x] **Responsiveness:** The layout is fully responsive, stacking vertically on mobile screens and transitioning to a two-column layout on wider screens (tablets/desktops) using CSS Flexbox.
-   [x] **Dynamic Time Display:** The current time in milliseconds is accurately displayed using `Date.now()` and updates every second.
-   [x] **Accessible Images:** The avatar `<img>` includes a descriptive `alt` attribute.
-   [x] **Accessible Links:** Social media links open in a new tab with `target="_blank"` and `rel="noopener noreferrer"` for security.
-   [x] **Keyboard Navigation:** All interactive elements (links) are keyboard-focusable with a visible focus style for better accessibility.
-   [x] **Distinct Lists:** Hobbies and Dislikes are presented in separate `<ul>` elements within their own sections.
